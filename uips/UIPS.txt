This is an IPS patcher.  I don't guarantee that it works, but it seems to.
I have included a binary for MS-DOS, which will also work under Windows 98
Second Edition and should also have no problems on NT-based systems, since
it doesn't do anything "dirty".  It's ANSI C, to the best of my knowledge,
so it should compile on almost anything.  I have also included a Linux ELF
statically-linked (against whatever glibc Red Hat 8.0 Linux uses) binary.

To run it, first MAKE A BACKUP OF THE FILE YOU ARE PATCHING.  This is VERY
important!  UIPS will NOT preserve your original file, and since it uses a
"modify-in-place" system, it will overwrite the file as it stands, meaning
that you cannot use an "undelete" program of any kind to recover your lost
file.  Back up first.  Then type:

   uips  filename.ext  patch.ips

where "filename.ext" is the name of the data file you intend to patch, and
"patch.ips" is the name of the patch file.  You must include the extension
of .IPS if present, since UIPS will *not* add it on automatically.  I hope
you know what you're doing.  You should see a little copyright blurb, then
the command prompt should return.  If you got no messages except the blurb
you should be fine.  Test and see.  There are a lot of "maybes" when using
IPS.

As I said, UIPS should compile on almost anything.  However, I have only a
PC running Win98SE and a modified Red Hat 8.0 Linux to test on, and I have
only done minimal testing, using these binaries. Please let me know if you
have trouble compiling UIPS especially on a non-Intel system.  If you have
gcc (djgpp, mingw32, cygwin, etc.), try typing "gcc -o uips uips.c".
